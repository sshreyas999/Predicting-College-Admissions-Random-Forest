# Predicting College Admissions (Random Forest)

# Objective  
Given certain metrics of a student, our task is to predict the probability of the student getting accepted into graduate programs. We will use a random forest to accomplish this task.

**GRE Score** - Out of 340  
**TOEFL Score** - Out of 120  
**University Rating** - Between 1 to 5 (5 being the best)  
**SOP** - Between 1 to 5 (5 being the best)  
**LOR** - Between 1 to 5 (5 being the best)  
**CGPA** - Out of 10  
**Research** - 1 if student has research experience, else 0  
**Chance of Admit** - Probability of getting accepted into graduate program
