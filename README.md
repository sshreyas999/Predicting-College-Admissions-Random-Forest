# Predicting College Admissions (Random Forest)

Code Written in Python using Jupyter Notebook. Open the notebook [here](https://github.com/sshreyas999/Predicting-College-Admissions-Random-Forest/blob/main/Random%20Forest%20-%20Predicting%20College%20Admissions.ipynb) for code and thorough analysis.


## Objective  
Given certain metrics of a student, our task is to predict the probability of the student getting accepted into graduate programs. We will use a random forest to accomplish this task.

## Dataset
The dataset contains 500 observations with the following variables:  
**GRE Score** - Out of 340  
**TOEFL Score** - Out of 120  
**University Rating** - Between 1 to 5 (5 being the best)  
**SOP** - Between 1 to 5 (5 being the best)  
**LOR** - Between 1 to 5 (5 being the best)  
**CGPA** - Out of 10  
**Research** - 1 if student has research experience, else 0  
**Chance of Admit** - Probability of getting accepted into graduate program

Take 80% of the data for training, the other 20% will serve as a validation set.

## Outline  
The following procedures are carried out in the notebook:
### Analyzing the Attributes  
Determine what predictor variables are useful for the task at hand. Apply appropriate transformations if needed.
### Model Fitting
In this case, usa  a Random Forest to make predictions. Find optimum parameters and record metrics.
### Evalutaion Metrics
Evaluation Metrics for this project are Mean Squared Error **(MSE)** and coefficient of determination **R^<sup>2</sup>**. Apart from evaluation metrics, we also analyze feature importance. 
### Predicting on a Custom Example
Provide a test case and look at the prediction.

## Conclusion
The final model explained about **84.9%** of the variability in **Chance of Admit**.  

Test Case:    
For the following student:  

**GRE Score** - 330  
**TOEFL Score** - 110  
**University Rating** - 4  
**SOP** - 4.5  
**LOR** - 4.5  
**CGPA** - 9.5  
**Research** - 0 (No experience)

The chance of getting accepted into the program is **88.2%**
